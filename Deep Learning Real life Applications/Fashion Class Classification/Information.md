# Introduction
##### The Global Fashion Industry is valued at three trillion dollars and accounts for two percent of the world's GDP.The fashion industry is undergoing a dramatic transformation by adopting new customer vision, machine learning and deep learning techniques. In this case study, we'll look at a hypothetical situation.I am assuming that a fashion retailer hired me to build a virtual stylish assistant that looks a customer instagram and facebook images and classifies what fashion category they are wearing either bags, dresses and pants.The virtual assistant can help the retailer detect and forecast fashion trends and launch targeted marketing campaign.

## About the Data:

##### I am using a fashion mnsit data. Its a dataset that contains a images of bag, shoes and dresses. I am using a convolution neural network to classify these images into 10 classes.

## About the model building:
               
               *CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
               *Tensorflow
               *Keras
