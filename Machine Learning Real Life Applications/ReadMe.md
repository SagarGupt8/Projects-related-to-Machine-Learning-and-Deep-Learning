# Machine Learning Real World Projects details :

## Following are the details of FinTech Case studies

 #### About the Data:
 
 The Data of these projects are manufactured fields based on trends found in real world Case Studies. The Fields describe
 what companies usually track from their users, and the distributions in real world analysis. This means that although,
 the data has been artificially created,the patterns associations, and distributions are not random. 
 
 This data serves as a good representation of what you may encounter in the workplace. That is,the datais rarely clean,
 and a lot of pre-processing is needed to get it ready for modelling.
 
 #### About the Case Studies:
 
 Case Study 1: Directing Customers to Subscription Through App Behavior Analysis.
 Case Study 2: Minimizing Churn Rate Through Analysis of Financial Habits.
 Case Study 3: Predicting the Likelihood of E-Signing a Loan Bases on Financial History.
 
 #### About the model building:
 
 In this, the model building process is composed of multiple parts. Some of things are given below:
           * Plotting with matplotlib and seaborn
           * Data Manipulation
           * Classification  Models from the Sklearn Library
           * K-Fold Cross Validation
           * Grid Search(Parameter Tuning)
           * Feature Selection algorithms.
