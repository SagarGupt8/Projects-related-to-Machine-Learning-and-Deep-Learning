 I have been working on machine learning since the lockdown began due to covid-19 pandemic. I found this data science field as my upcoming career opportunity. I have learned  lot's of stuff from various sources and  , now I'm confident to say that , I'm passionate about exploring more information and gain more knowledge towards this career path. And so to enhance my skills I  have worked on Real World applications which are mostly having supervised data and i also implement machine learning algorithms on Real World Applications.

#### There are five projects i have done till now. They are as follows :
        
       a) Directing Customers to Subscription Through App Behavior Analysis.
       b) Minimizing Churn Rate Through Analysis of Financial Habits.
